**Dispatcher pattern:**

The **dispatcher pattern** is a method for scheduling (or _dispatching_) code for execution from a worker-[thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread\_\(computing\)) to the main-thread.  In object-oriented programming, a member variable (sometimes called a member field) is a variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods (member functions). In class-based languages, these are distinguished into two types. If there is only one copy of the variable shared with all instances of the class, it is called a class variable or static member variable.  Iff each instance of the class has its own copy of the variable, the variable is called an instance variable.

#### Quaternion:&#x20;

In mathematics, the **quaternions** are a number system that extends the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex\_number). In Unity, [Quaternions](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Quaternion.html) are used to represent rotations.

#### **Prefab**: &#x20;

Unity’s **Prefab** system allows you to create, configure, and store a GameObject complete with all its components, property values, and child **GameObjects** as a reusable Asset. The **Prefab** Asset acts as a template from which you can create new **Prefab** instances in the **Scene.**[ _Read more_](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html)**.**\
