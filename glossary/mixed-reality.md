#### Dispatcher pattern

The dispatcher pattern is a method for scheduling \(or _dispatching_\) code for execution from a worker-[thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computing%29) to the main-thread.

#### Member variable

In [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), a **member variable** \(sometimes called a **member** [**field**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_%28computer_science%29)\) is a [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_%28programming%29) that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its [methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_%28computer_science%29) \(member functions\). In [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_science%29)-based languages, these are distinguished into two types: if there is only one copy of the variable shared with all instances of the class, it is called a [class variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_variable) or static member variable; while if each instance of the class has its own copy of the variable, the variable is called an [instance variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_variable).

#### Quaternion

In mathematics, the **quaternions** are a number system that extends the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number). In Unity, [Quaternions](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Quaternion.html) are used to represent rotations.
