# What is Playground?

* Experimenting and changing any code in the playground and clicking on the **Run** button will **run your code**. Running the code will not affect any original code in the playground you are currently using. Original **code can be restored by refreshing the browser.**
* You need to **save your changes** to create a new version of the the code in Playground. That way, you can share the link with anyone.
