# What is an Hemispheric Light?

A **hemispheric light** is an easy way to simulate an ambient environment light. In our case, we are doing the bare minimum, just giving a name to the light and set it's location.

Setting y location to 1 while our main object is in the center \(0,0,0\) location will move the light above the object.
