# How to load a 3D Model

{% embed url="https://threejs.org/examples/\#webgl\_loader\_gltf" caption="ThreeJS gltf loader demo" %}

Only a few loaders \(e.g. ObjectLoader\) are included by default with three.js â€” others should be added to your app individually.

```typescript
import { GLTFLoader } from '/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader.js';

//Model loader
const manager = new LoadingManager();
const loader = new GLTFLoader(manager).setPath("/assets/models/AyaSofia/");
let modelLoaded = false;
```

Once you've imported a loader, you're ready to add a model to your scene. Syntax varies among different loaders â€” when using another format, check the examples and documentation for that loader. For glTF, usage with global scripts would be:

Change the onSelect function to load and place the model, instead of the Sphere mesh we were placing previously.

```typescript
function onSelect() {
	if (reticle.visible && !modelLoaded) {
		loader.load(
			"GM_poly.gltf",
			function (gltf) {
				gltf.scene.children[0].position.setFromMatrixPosition(reticle.matrix);
				scene.add(gltf.scene);
				modelLoaded = true;
			},
			undefined,
			function (error) {
				console.error(error);
			}
		);
	}
}
```

We can add event callbacks for loading manager.

```typescript
manager.onStart = function (url, itemsLoaded, itemsTotal) {
	console.log("Started loading file: " + url + ".\nLoaded " + itemsLoaded + " of " + itemsTotal + " files.");
};

manager.onLoad = function () {
	console.log("Loading complete!");
};

manager.onProgress = function (url, itemsLoaded, itemsTotal) {
	console.log("Loading file: " + url + ".\nLoaded " + itemsLoaded + " of " + itemsTotal + " files.");
};

manager.onError = function (url) {
	console.log("There was an error loading " + url);
};

```

See [GLTFLoader documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader) for further details.

### Exercise

* [ ] Try other object types and loaders to add different models to your scene. You can find more models under three.js/examples/models.

### Troubleshooting

You've spent hours modeling an artisanal masterpiece, you load it into the webpage, and â€” oh no! ðŸ˜­ It's distorted, miscolored, or missing entirely. Start with these troubleshooting steps:

1. Check the JavaScript console for errors, and make sure you've used an _onError_ callback when calling _.load\(\)_ to log the result.
2. View the model in another application. For glTF, drag-and-drop viewers are available for [three.js](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/) and [babylon.js](http://sandbox.babylonjs.com/). If the model appears correctly in one or more applications, [file a bug against three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/new). If the model cannot be shown in any application, we strongly encourage filing a bug with the application used to create the model.
3. Try scaling the model up or down by a factor of 1000. Many models are scaled differently, and large models may not appear if the camera is inside the model.
4. Try to add and position a light source. The model may be hidden in the dark.
5. Look for failed texture requests in the network tab, like _C:\\Path\To\Model\texture.jpg_. Use paths relative to your model instead, such as _images/texture.jpg_ â€” this may require editing the model file in a text editor.
