You might have an idea for an application using AI and not have anyone to build it. You might be a programmer and want to try out your ideas  and [Azure Custom Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/?WT.mc_id=aiml-8438-ayyonet) before you start writing code. No matter what your coding skills are, if you want to prototype an application with AI, [**Power Platform**](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=aiml-8438-ayyonet) and it's [**AI Builder** ](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/ai-builder/?WT.mc_id=aiml-8438-ayyonet)feature is a **fast** and **easy option**. 

This article explains what the power platform is as well as goes through a step by step process to create an app that detects objects from photos using [**Power Apps**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/signup-for-powerapps?WT.mc_id=aiml-8438-ayyonet) and [**AI Builder.**](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/use-ai-builder?WT.mc_id=aiml-8438-ayyonet) ****Check out the video below to see the app we will build to detect different [Mixed Reality](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/discover/mixed-reality?WT.mc_id=aiml-8438-ayyonet) Headsets such as HoloLens version 1 and 2 Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality headsets and their hand controllers.
