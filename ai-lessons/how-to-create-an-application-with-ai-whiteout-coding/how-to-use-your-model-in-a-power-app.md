Once you are happy with the design, you can publish and share your app. You can use your new app by downloading Power Apps from [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/power-apps/id1047318566), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.msapps&hl=en_US&gl=US) or [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/power-apps/9nblggh5z8f3?ocid=9nblggh5z8f3_ORSEARCH_Bing&rtc=1#activetab=pivot:overviewtab) stores.
