# What is UnityWebRequest?

\*\*\*\*[**UnityWebRequest**](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.4/Documentation/Manual/UnityWebRequest.html) ****provides a modular system for composing HTTP requests and handling HTTP responses. The primary goal of the UnityWebRequest system is to allow Unity games to interact with web browser back-ends. It also supports high-demand features such as chunked HTTP requests, streaming POST/PUT operations, and full control over HTTP headers and verbs.

The system consists of two layers:

* A [High-Level API](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.4/Documentation/Manual/UnityWebRequest-HLAPI.html) \(HLAPI\) wraps the Low-Level API and provides a convenient interface for performing common operations
* A [Low-Level API](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.4/Documentation/Manual/UnityWebRequest-LLAPI.html) \(LLAPI\) provides maximum flexibility for more advanced users
