# Concepts

Hand interaction is a very natural way to interact with 3D models. As an interaction model, the use of hands is great for new users coupled with voice, eye tracking or head gaze. There is a low learning curve and consistent UX across hand tracking.

Hand interaction may be suitable for your mixed reality application if any of the scenarios below apply to your mixed reality application:

- You want users to touch holograms and perform precision holographic manipulations.
- You want users to have the lowest learning curve and most intuitive interactions.
- Your users are generally mobile, covering a large space or moving between spaces.

When implementing hands as an interaction model for your mixed reality application, consider the following affordances and behaviors to help new users:

- To indicate that hand interaction is working, add hand mesh, a fingertip affordance or hand rays to your mixed reality application.
- To provide guidance on what a user can do with their hands, consider adding grabbable handles or a bounding box when the user's hand is near an object.
- To confirm that the user has completed an action with their hands, incorporate audible tones and/or animations on grab and release.
