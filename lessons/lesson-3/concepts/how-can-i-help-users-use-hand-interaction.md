# How Can I Help Users Use Hand Interactions?

When implementing hands interaction for your mixed reality application, consider the following affordances and behaviors to help new users:

- To indicate that hand interaction is working, add hand mesh, fingertip visualization or hand rays to your mixed reality application.
- To provide guidance on what a user can do with their hands, consider adding grabbable handles or a bounding box when the user's hand is near an object.
- To confirm that the user has completed an action with their hands, incorporate audible tones and/or animations on grab and release.
