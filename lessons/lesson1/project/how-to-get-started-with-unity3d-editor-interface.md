The Unity Editor has **four main sections:**

####  Scene view 

This is where you can edit the current Scene by selecting and moving objects in the 3D space for the game. In this kit, the game level is contained in one Scene.

#### Hierarchy window 

This is a list of all the GameObjects in a Scene. Every object in your game is a GameObject. These can be placed in a parent-child hierarchy, which lets you group objects — this means that when the parent object is moved, all of its children will move at the same time.

#### Inspector window 

This display all settings related to the currently selected object. You will explore this window more during the walkthrough.

#### Project window 

This is where you manage your Project Assets. Assets are the media files used in a Project \(for example, images, 3D models and sound files\). The Project window acts like a file explorer, and can be used to explore and create folders on your computer. When the walkthrough asks you to find an Asset at a given file path, use this window.

**TIP**: If your Editor layout doesn’t match the image above, use the **layout drop-down** menu at the top right of the toolbar to select **Default**.
