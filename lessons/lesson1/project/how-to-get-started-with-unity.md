# How to Get Started with Unity

## What is Unity?

[Unity](https://unity.com/) is a platform, often referred to as an *engine*, that can be used to develop mixed reality applications. The benefit of using such a platform is that Unity has various built-in functionality which can help developers bring their ideas to life faster as opposed to starting from scratch.

Although this lesson covers basic functionality for developing a mixed reality application in Unity, we recommend taking some time to explore the tutorials provided on [Unity Learn](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials) for further guidance.

In addition to tutorials on Unity Learn, Unity provides a [manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html) to help you learn how to use the editor. Furthermore, the [Unity Scripting Reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/index.html) contains details of the scripting API that Unity provides.

## Download Unity Hub

The [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedUnityHub.html) is a management tool that you can use to manage all of your Unity Projects and installations. Unity Hub is great for managing multiple installations of the Unity Editor along with their associated components, creating new Projects, and opening existing Projects. Before you install Unity Hub, ensure that your pc meets the [system requirements](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html) for Unity.

On the [Download Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) page, select **Download Unity Hub** to download the application and begin the installation process.

To install and use the Unity Editor, you must have a Unity Developer Network (UDN) account. If you already have an account, sign in, choose your licenses type, and proceed to the Installing the Unity Editor section.

If you do not have an account, follow the prompts to create one. You can choose to create a Unity ID or use one of the social sign-ins.

Once the Unity Hub installation is complete, launch the Unity Hub.
There are 3 tabs within the Unity Hub. A description of what each tab entails is provided below:

## Install Unity

To complete this lesson, you will need to install a Unity version appropriate for your device. For HoloLens 1 development, you will need to install Unity version 2018.4 LTS. For all other devices, you will need to install Unity version 2019.2.X.

**Hololens (1st gen)**

If you are developing for a HoloLens 1, you will need to access version 2018.4 LTS via the [Long Term Support Releases](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases). Select **Unity Hub** next to the latest Unity 2018.4 Expand **LTS Release 2018.4.17f1** and select **Download (Win)** under **Unity Editor Download Assistant**.

## Create a New Unity 3D Project

Now that Unity is installed, you can create a new project using that version. In the Unity Hub, navigate to the **Projects** tab and click **New**. If you have multiple versions of Unity installed, click the drop down arrow next to **New** and select a version that is 2019.2.X.

Enter a **Project Name** for your project and select a **Location** to save the project. When working on Windows, there is a MAX_PATH limit of 255 characters. Unity is affected by these limits and may fail to compile if any file path is longer than 255 characters. Consequently, it is strongly recommended to store your Unity project as close to the root of the drive as possible.

Click **Create** to create the project. Once the project has been created, the Unity Editor will launch.
