# What Device Should I Use for My Mixed Reality Experience?

There are two main types of devices that deliver Windows Mixed Reality experiences:

1. **Holographic devices**. These are characterized by the device's ability to place digital content in the real world as if it were really there.
2. **Immersive devices**. These are characterized by the device's ability to create a sense of "presence" -- hiding the physical world, and replacing it with a digital experience.


|Characteristic  |Holographic Devices  |Immersive Devices  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Example Device**     |    Microsoft HoloLens 2   |   Samsung HMD Odyssey+  |
|**Display**     |    See-through display. Allows user to see the physical environment while wearing the headset.     |    Opaque display. Blocks out the physical environment while wearing the headset.     |
|**Movement**     |    Full six-degrees-of-freedom movement, both rotation and translation.     |    Full six-degrees-of-freedom movement, both rotation and translation.     |

Note, whether a device is connected to or tethered to a separate PC (via USB cable or Wi-Fi) or self-contained (untethered) does not reflect whether a device is holographic or immersive. Certainly, features that improve mobility lead to better experiences, and both holographic and immersive devices could be tethered or untethered.
