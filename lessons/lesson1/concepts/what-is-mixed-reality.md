# What is Mixed Reality?

Mixed reality is the result of blending the physical world with the digital world. Mixed reality is the next evolution in human, computer, and environment interaction and unlocks possibilities that before now were restricted to our imaginations. It is made possible by advancements in computer vision, graphical processing power, display technology, and input systems. The term mixed reality was originally introduced in a 1994 paper by Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino, "[A Taxonomy of Mixed Reality Visual Displays.](https://etclab.mie.utoronto.ca/people/paul_dir/IEICE94/ieice.html)" Their paper introduced the concept of the virtuality continuum, and focused on how the categorization of taxonomy applied to displays. Since then, the application of mixed reality goes beyond displays. It also includes environmental input, spatial sound, and location.

## The Mixed Reality Spectrum

Since mixed reality blends both physical and digital worlds, these two realities define the polar ends of a spectrum known as the virtuality continuum. For simplicity, we refer to this as the mixed reality spectrum. On the left-hand side we have physical reality in which we, humans, exist; on the right-hand side we have the corresponding digital reality.

**Augmented vs. Virtual Reality**

Most mobile phones on the market today have little to no environmental understanding capabilities. Thus the experiences they offer cannot mix between physical and digital realities. The experiences that overlay graphics on video streams of the physical world are *augmented reality*. The experiences that occlude your view to present a digital experience are virtual reality. As you can see, the experiences enabled between these two extremes is *mixed reality*.

Most augmented reality and virtual reality offerings available today represent a very small part of this spectrum. They are, however, subsets of the larger mixed reality spectrum. Windows 10 is built with the entire spectrum in mind, and allows blending digital representations of people, places, and things with the real world.
