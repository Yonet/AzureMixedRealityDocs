Technological advancement is what has enabled mixed reality experiences. There are no devices today that can run experiences across the entire spectrum. However, Windows 10 provides a common mixed reality platform for both device manufacturers and developers. Devices today can support a specific range within the mixed reality spectrum. Over time, new devices will expand that range. In the future, holographic devices will become more immersive, and immersive devices will become more holographic.

Often, it is best to think what type of experience an application or game developer wants to create. The experiences will typically target a specific point or part on the spectrum. Then, developers should consider the capabilities of devices they want to target. For example, experiences that rely on the physical world will run best on HoloLens.

- **Near physical reality**. Users remain present in their physical environment and are never made to believe they have left that environment.
- **Fully mixed reality**. These experiences blend the real world and the digital world. Viewers who have seen the movie [Jumanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumanji) can reconcile how the physical structure of the house where the story took place was blended with a jungle environment.
- **Near digital reality**. Users experience a completely digital environment, and are unaware of what occurs in the physical environment around them.
