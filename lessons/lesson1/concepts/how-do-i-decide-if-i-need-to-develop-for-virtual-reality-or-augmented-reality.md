Technological advancement is what has enabled mixed reality experiences. There are no devices today that can run experiences across the entire spectrum. However, Windows 10 provides a common mixed reality platform for both device manufacturers and developers. Devices today can support a specific range within the mixed reality spectrum. Over time, new devices will expand that range. In the future, holographic devices will become more immersive, and immersive devices will become more holographic.

Often, it is best to think what type of experience an application or game developer wants to create. The experiences will typically target a specific point or part on the spectrum. Then, developers should consider the capabilities of devices they want to target. For example, experiences that rely on the physical world are best for Augmented reality.
