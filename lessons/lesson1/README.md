# 01 - Introduction to Mixed Reality

### Overview

In this lesson, you will learn about the **basic concepts** about **Mixed Reality** and explore the **applications of Mixed Reality** in different **industries**. 

In the **Project** section, you will set up your first Mixed Reality project using **Unity** and **Mixed Reality Tool Kit**.

You can jump directly into setting up your first project on the [How to get started with mixed reality development using Unity3D section](project/how-to-get-started-with-mixed-reality-development-using-unity.md).

* You might be prompted to select a configuration. You can choose the default MRTK configuration or if you are developing for an HoloLens device, you can choose the configuration for the appropriate version.
* On your hierarchy panel, you will see **MixedRealityToolkit** and **MixedRealityPlayspace** drop downs along with your default directional light.
* Your scene camera is grouped underneath **MixedRealityPlayspace** dropdown and setup for Augmented Reality camera with a black background to render transparent. This will allow your device to stream your camera view and display your virtual objects on top.
