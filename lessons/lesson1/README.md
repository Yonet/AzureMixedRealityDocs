# 01 - Introduction to Mixed Reality

## Concepts

In this lesson, you will learn about the basic concepts about Mixed Reality and explore the applications of Mixed Reality in different industries. 

You will set up your first Mixed Reality project using Unity and Mixed Reality Tool Kit.

You can jump directly into setting up your first project here on the[ How to get started with mixed reality development using Unity3D](./#how-to-get-started-with-mixed-reality-development-using-unity) section.

### How to enable Developer Mode in HoloLens 1?

1. Turn on your HoloLens and put on the device.
2. Perform the [bloom](%20https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/system-gesture#bloom?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet) gesture to launch the main menu.
3. Gaze at the **Settings** tile and perform the [air-tap](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/gaze-and-commit#composite-gestures?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet) gesture. Perform a second air tap to place the app in your environment. The Settings app will launch after you place it.
4. Select the **Update** menu item.
5. Select the **For developers** menu item.
6. Enable **Developer Mode**. This will allow you to [deploy apps from Visual Studio ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/using-visual-studio?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet)to your HoloLens.
7. Optional: Scroll down and also enable **Device Portal**. This will also allow you to connect to the [Windows Device Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/using-the-windows-device-portal?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet) on your HoloLens from a web browser.

### How to get started with HoloLens Seed Project?

### How to create a new scene?

* On the Project panel, right click and select Create &gt; Scene.

![Create a new scene in Unity3D](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-156.png)

* Name your scene and drag it under Scenes folder for organization purposes.

### How to configure a new scene with MRTK?

* Create a new scene.
* On the top bar, select **Mixed Reality Toolkit &gt; Add scene and configure**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-153.png)

* You might be prompted to select a configuration. You can choose the default MRTK configuration or if you are developing for an HoloLens device, you can choose the configuration for the appropriate version.
* On your hierarchy panel, you will see **MixedRealityToolkit** and **MixedRealityPlayspace** drop downs along with your default directional light.
* Your scene camera is grouped underneath **MixedRealityPlayspace** dropdown and setup for Augmented Reality camera with a black background to render transparent. This will allow your device to stream your camera view and display your virtual objects on top.
