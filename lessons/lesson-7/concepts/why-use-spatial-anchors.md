# Why use Spatial Anchors?

Using [Azure Spatial Anchors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/overview?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet) allows you to share any information in specific context, time and space. Some of the use cases are having user guides for machinery, inventory information, [way-finding applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/concepts/anchor-relationships-way-finding?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet), educational applications, [multi-player games](https://news.microsoft.com/features/beyond-the-blocks-how-the-latest-technology-made-minecraft-earth-a-reality/?WT.mc_id=github-mixedrealitycurriculum-ayyonet). Having smartphones and having access to the GPS data changed the apps we build and enabled ride sharing and location based recommendation applications. Developing with Azure Spatial Anchors will help you deliver contextual data at the right time and place and will open up new possibilities indoors.
