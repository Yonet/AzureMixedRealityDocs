# How to add Pins to your map?

There are 2 ways to add Pins to your map. First, you can directly attach a MapPin component to your Map GameObjects which you want to attach to the MapRenderer at a specific lat-lon. When attached, the MapRenderer will take over positioning of the MapPin's Transform component.

Second way is to add a MapPinLayer, covered on the next section.
