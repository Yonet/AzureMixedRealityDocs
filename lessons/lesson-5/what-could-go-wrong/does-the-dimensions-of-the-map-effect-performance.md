# Does the dimensions of the map effect performance?

Larger map dimensions will require more data to be downloaded and rendered. This will affect the overall performance of the app. It is recommended to stay with the default settings or smaller, or only increase the map dimensions on devices that are capable. Regardless, the map dimensions are clamped to a maximum size.
