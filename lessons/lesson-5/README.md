### How to add Pins to your map?

There are 2 ways to add Pins to your map. First, you can directly attach a MapPin component to your Map GameObjects which you want to attach to the MapRenderer at a specific lat-lon. When attached, the MapRenderer will take over positioning of the MapPin's Transform component.

### How to add pins using tthe MapPinLayer?

This approach is better suited for large data sets where clustering may be required:

* Add a `MapPinLayer` component to the MapRenderer's GameObject. If clustering is enabled, check this setting on the layer and attach a prefab that has a ClusterMapPin component.

![Map Pin Layer Script](../../.gitbook/assets/mappinlayerwithclustering.png)

* In a script, get a reference to the `MapPinLayer` and add `MapPin` instances to the the layer's `MapPins` collection.

```csharp
foreach (var mapPinLocation in _maoPinLocations)
{
    var mapPin = Instantiate(_mapPinPrefab);
    mapPin.Location = mapPinLocation;
    _mapPinLayer.MapPins.Add(mapPin);
}â€‹

```

### What is clustring map pins means?

An advantage to using the MapPinLayer is that it supports clustering. If a ClusterMapPin prefab is specified on the layer, MapPins will be clustered automatically. When MapPins are clustered, the ClusterMapPin is shown in the place of the many MapPins that associate to it.

Clustering is highly recommended for large datasets as this will reduce the number of MapPin instances that need to be rendered for zoomed out views. Besides this rendering performance benefit, it is often preferable to cluster MapPins from a usability perspective since dense, cluttered views will make it more difficult for the user to interact with individual MapPins.

Clusters are created at every zoom level, so as the zoom level of the MapRenderer changes, the visible clusters and MapPins may change as well.

### How to add labels to your map?

### How to customize the map texture?

## What could go wrong?

### Does the dimensions of the map effect performance?

Larger map dimensions will require more data to be downloaded and rendered. This will affect the overall performance of the app. It is recommended to stay with the default settings or smaller, or only increase the map dimensions on devices that are capable. Regardless, the map dimensions are clamped to a maximum size.

### Does Map Terrain Type effect performance?

 The `Flat` map terrain type requires the least amount of performance overhead. Both elevation and high resolution 3D models are disabled. The map terrain surface will be flat.

### Can I customize the materials and shaders? 

It is possible to replace the material used for either the terrain or the clipping volume wall.

When doing this, it is recommended to make a copy of the base shaders, which are imported as part of the NuGet package under _lib\unity\map\Resources_. Use the copies made of these shaders as the starting point for new materials.

 Importantly, the `ENABLE_ELEVATION_TEXTURE` keyword used by the shaders will need to be maintained. Certain draw calls for the terrain require an elevation texture while others do not.

### Can quality settings effect the performance?

It is important to note that the level of detail offset can have a large impact on performance. The trade-off being higher quality will come with a higher performance impact where the cache size will grow more quickly. Lowering the quality may be beneficial on devices that are performance constrained.

### Can adding pins would slow down my application?

Creating and adding many MapPins at once, either to a MapPinLayer or as children of the MapRenderer, could be time consuming and thus cause a frame hitch. If the MapPins can be initialized and added all at startup, this may be an acceptable one time hit. However, if data is being streamed and converted to MapPins throughout the app's lifetime, consider spreading out the MapPin creation and addition over multiple frames, i.e. time slice the additions. This will help to maintain render performance.
